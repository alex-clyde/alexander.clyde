Proxy variables and Feedback Effects in Decision Making [[Draft Available Soon]](Documents/Proxy_Variables_in_Equilibrium___Draft.pdf)

<summary>Abstract</summary>
<br>
When using data, often an analyst only has access to proxies or measurements of the true variables of interest. I propose a framework that models economic decision makers as ‘flawed statisticians’ who assume potentially noisy proxy variables are perfectly measured. Due to feedback from the decision maker's choices to the distribution over variables, a notion of equilibrium is required to close the model. I illustrate the concept with applications to policing and crime, market entry and advertising. In these examples, we see that (1) very small imperfections in the proxy variable leading to large distortions in beliefs (2) monotonicity in the quality of decision in the extent of proxy `noise’ even when without equilibrium effects there is non-monotonicity and (3) controlling for more variables distorts beliefs even when without controls we have correct or approximately correct beliefs.
